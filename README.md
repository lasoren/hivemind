# Hivemind

A hackathon project from HackMIT 2014. Type in a query, and we'll trawl the Internet (read: Google News) and find relevant articles. Then, using some magic sauce and some poached API calls, we'll return a score for how positively the Internet thinks of your search term. Cool right?

# So, this is sick, did you win?

Unfortunately, the top 8 teams got to present, and in the confusion we were called up, and then told otherwise. We were likely 9th or 10th. Several of the winning teams were disqualified after the fact, so we really should have been in the top 8, but I'm not bitter or anything.
